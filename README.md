chebyshev's inequality (data science)

Chebyshev’s inequality is an extremely useful theorem when combining with other theorem and it is a bedrock of confidence interval. In this blog, I will illustrate the theorem and how it works using python.
Before we start coding, let’s look at the theorem. The Chebyshev’s inequality states that, for wide class of probability distribution, no more than a certain amount of values can be more than a certain distance from the mean, with the formula as follow.

Where X is a random variable, μ is an expected value of X, σ is a standard deviation of X and k > 0.
